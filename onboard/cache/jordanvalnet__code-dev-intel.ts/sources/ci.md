  # The package resolves native binaries (ripgrep, ast-grep) per platform and branches on
  # `process.platform` for realpath/case handling, the user cache directory, spawn shapes,
  # atomic rename and line endings. Running one runner could never have caught a mistake
  # in any of that, so the gate runs on all three.
  #
  # `suite: runtime-compat` is the Node 20 entry: `engines.node` claims `>=18`, but the
  # dev toolchain cannot run there (vitest 5 requires `^22.12 || ^24 || >=26`, and
  # `node --experimental-strip-types` — which the CLI integration test spawns — only
  # exists from 22.6). What that job can honestly prove is the thing a consumer on Node 20
  # actually runs: the COMPILED package. So it lints, type-checks, builds and self-tests
  # `dist/`, and leaves the vitest suite to the runtimes that support it.
